# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a script that deploys the ProjectNFT contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy-project-nft.js
npx hardhat help
```
