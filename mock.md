## How do Gitcoin grants work?

### Gitcoin's mission is to build & fund public goods

Our grants program, which runs for a two-week period every 3 months, connects builders & funders in Web3

Gitcoin grants is a three-sided marketplace:
💰 Matching Funders
💲 Individual Contributors
👩‍💻 Grantees

## 💰 Matching Funders

These are typically Web3 projects, like Uniswap or 0xPolygon, who generously commit large sums of capital (often $100K+) to our matching pools.

## 💲 Individual Contributors

These are ordinary people, like you and I, who might donate $5-10 (or much more!) towards a specific grant

## 👩‍💻 Grantees

These are early-stage builders - often open-source devs - who are seeking funding for their project
