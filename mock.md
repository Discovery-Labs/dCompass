## How do Gitcoin grants work?

### Gitcoin's mission is to build & fund public goods

Our grants program, which runs for a two-week period every 3 months, connects builders & funders in Web3

Gitcoin grants is a three-sided marketplace:
💰 Matching Funders
💲 Individual Contributors
👩‍💻 Grantees

## 💰 Matching Funders

These are typically Web3 projects, like Uniswap or 0xPolygon, who generously commit large sums of capital (often $100K+) to our matching pools.

## 💲 Individual Contributors

These are ordinary people, like you and I, who might donate $5-10 (or much more!) towards a specific grant

## 👩‍💻 Grantees

These are early-stage builders - often open-source devs - who are seeking funding for their project

## What is Quadratic funding?

##### [Before diving in deeper, we suggest you to head over >>WTF IS QF?<< and play with the variables to understand the formula.](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000)

> The quadratic funding mechanism (QF) is a concrete proposal for turning your small donations into something much larger. It requires a simple formula to achieve this goal.

> Crowdfund individual donations towards open source projects (try to have the maximum of contributors, it's the number of participants that counts, not the amount of contribution). A match from governments, grant programs, or private philanthropists (offered by sponsors/donors for the grant's round fund).

## Why is Quadratic funding powerful?

The QF Mechanism measures the breadth of contributors, not the depth of contributions - which is a very democratic funding model.

QF pushes power to the edges of the network!

> Economist Glen Weyl has called QF the "optimal way to fund public goods that a broad base of the population cares about".
